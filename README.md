<strong>Pint-Perfect</strong>

With over 2,500 different brands of beer in the US and over 4,000 breweries to choose from, the decision of what beer to drink can be confusing, time consuming, and disappointing if you make the wrong choice.

Pint-Perfect is here to ease your decision making process and can help you to find perfect beer based on weather, location, or a type of event you plan on attending.  The app uses the Weather Underground API and BreweryDB API to make these recommendations and it was built using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Materialize, mySQL, Node.JS and Passport for authentication.
